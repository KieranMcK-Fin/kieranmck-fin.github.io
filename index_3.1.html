                    <p>This event which took place in the 2nd semester of 2nd year was an invaluable chance to develop an idea which had been in my notepad for around 2 years, while also gaining experience and making great connections within the industry. As it was my idea, I lead a team of 4 competing against around 20 other teams/ideas. Over an 8 week period we sat through many guest lectures that gave us great insight into the world of entreprenuership and start-ups, before finally competing for a prize of Â£1500 in funding and professional assitance in getting the start-up founded. On the final week we were tasked with delivering a pitch to over 100 attendees and a panel of judges that would rate the idea on a number of metrics.</p>
                    <p>Overall, leading the pitch was extremely interesting, as someone who never spoke to a crowd before it was very nerving, walking to the podium it felt very intense, but as soon as I started speaking it became very natural. We took turns answering questions from the judges and in the end we had been voted as the best pitch by the audience.</p>
                    <p>*also did door-to-door market research and surveys*</p>
