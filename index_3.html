                        <p>I joined one of the 3 UoD teams entered in the Univerities Buisness Challenge in my first semester. We started strong in the first round, where 8 teams from around the UK competed over a 6-week period to run a simulated business, trying to generate as much profit as possible while also building and maintaining a strong balance sheet. The simulation had great depth, which involved social externalities. For example, we had to keep costs low, while also paying fair wages and pricing responsibly as there was a reputation metric that would be considered and effect future sales. We were very successful in this stage and quickly gained first place and held it for the duration of the round, finishing with around 25% higher profits than second place qualifying us for the second round along with around 30 of the original 125 teams</p>
                        <p>The second round would be the semi-finals, there were 3 semi-finals held across the UK. We were in the Edinburgh Semi-finals and competed with a range of universities including ones from England. The second round definitely had a more immersive side to it, as on top of having to complete a similar business simulation once again measured by profit, there were also points to be won through more qualitative metrics as teams had to build impromptu marketing campaigns and adverts. Once again we did very well placing 4th, unfortunately it was the top 3 teams that would qualify for the finals, I am not too proud to admit that Iâ€™m still stung by missing the cut by only 0.07% on the points.</p>
